# navierstokescode
Code for understanding the Navier Stokes Equations

## ns.py
This script has a bunch of functions that can be called to calculate things related to fluid dynamics, plotting and data manipulation. Such as:
  - solve_continuity_equation_3d  
  - calculate_rate_of_strain_2D  
  - calculate_rate_of_strain_3D  
  - calculate_deviatoric_stress  
  - plot_fields  
  - initialize_pressure_with_high_point_3d  

## run_some_ns_code.ipynb
This notebook is for running code, plotting things and exploring fluid dynamics.
