    "# continuity equation example\n",
    "In this example of solving the continuity equation in three dimensions, we simulate fluid flow within a 3D domain using a computational approach based on PyTorch. The fluid velocity components (u, v, w) are initialized with zero velocity, and the pressure field (p) is initialized with a single high-pressure point at the center of the grid. We employ a finite-difference scheme to iteratively solve the continuity equation, which ensures mass conservation within the fluid domain. As the simulation progresses over multiple time steps, the high-pressure point serves as a source, and we observe how pressure propagates and spreads throughout the 3D space. The final pressure field is visualized, providing insights into how pressure disturbances evolve in a fluid medium. This example demonstrates the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and numerical methods for simulating fluid behavior in three dimensions."
